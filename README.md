# Tello_object_detection

The purpose of this repo is to use Python programming with a Tello EDU drone in order to perform tasks such as object detection, autonimous flight, and other features that regard machine learning and computer vision. 

The imported CV models come from the  [Tensorflow 2 Detection Model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) that can be found in the [Tensorflow models Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)


**Instructions**

My repo will contain models found on the before mentiond [Tensorflow models Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models), but there are many other models on the repo that you could import. If you want to download a specific model then run this [Colab Notebook](https://github.com/ctrivino1/Tello_object_detection/blob/main/Saving_Object_detectinon_models_for_tello_drone.ipynb). Note, that you will need to change the path the '.tar' and '.pbtxt' files to the model you are trying to download. 

If you get lost with the code and what it is doing, you can always upload it in chatgpt and get help/comments from there. You can also ask chatgpt to change the code to download a specific model you want as well. This is helpful with saving a little bit of time. 

The .py files to run object detection can be found in the 'Tello-Edu' file.
