# Tello_object_detection

The purpose of this repo is to use Python programming with a Tello EDU drone in order to perform tasks such as object detection, autonimous flight, and other features that regard machine learning and computer vision. 

The imported CV models come from the  [Tensorflow 2 Detection Model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) that can be found in the [Tensorflow models Repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
